# Data-Preprocessing-Sanity-Checks-EDA-Techniques-Statistical-Analysis-and-Multivariate-Analysis
 In this project, I carefully managed tasks across two datasets, ensuring data integrity. I conducted sanity tests, handled missing data, managed outliers, and performed comprehensive analysis. This systematic approach extracted meaningful insights, contributing to understanding.


**Data Preprocessing, Sanity Checks, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Techniques:**

_**Sanity Tests Conducted:**_

* Ensured data integrity by running sanity tests to check for inconsistencies, such as data types, ranges, and duplicates.
Verified that the data conforms to expected patterns and distributions.
* Conducted preliminary assessments to identify any anomalies that may require further investigation.

_**Handling Missing Data:**_

* Employed strategies such as imputation, deletion, or model-based methods to address missing data.
* Evaluated the impact of missing values on the overall dataset and applied appropriate techniques to mitigate biases.
* Considered the reasons behind missingness to determine the most suitable approach for handling missing data effectively.

_**Dealing with Potential Outliers:**_

* Employed statistical techniques like Z-score analysis, box plots, or clustering methods to detect outliers.
* Assessed the significance and potential impact of outliers on the analysis.
* Implemented methods such as trimming, winsorization, or transformation to mitigate the influence of outliers on the results.

_**Uni-variate, Bi-variate, and Multivariate Analysis:**_

* Conducted uni-variate analysis to explore the distribution and summary statistics of individual variables.
* Performed bi-variate analysis to examine relationships between pairs of variables, using techniques like correlation analysis or scatter plots.
* Employed multivariate analysis techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or factor analysis to uncover patterns and relationships among multiple variables simultaneously.

_**Drawing Conclusions Based on Analysis:**_

* Synthesized findings from exploratory analyses to draw meaningful insights and conclusions.
* Identified key trends, patterns, and associations within the data.
* Formulated hypotheses or recommendations based on the observed relationships and insights derived from the analysis.

_**Statistical Operations and Further Analysis**_:

* Applied statistical operations such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, or clustering to deepen the understanding of the data.
* Conducted inferential statistics to make predictions or infer properties of the population from the sample.
* Explored additional avenues for analysis, including subgroup analysis or sensitivity testing, to assess the robustness of findings and insights.


**Conclusion:**

In summary, the comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory analysis undertaken encompassed various critical steps. Through sanity tests, missing data handling, outlier detection, and diverse exploratory analyses, we gained valuable insights into the datasets. Uni-variate, bi-variate, and multivariate analyses allowed for a thorough examination of the data's characteristics and relationships. Drawing conclusions based on these analyses facilitated the formulation of informed decisions and recommendations. Additionally, statistical operations and further analysis deepened our understanding and provided additional insights. Overall, the systematic approach to data exploration and analysis has laid a solid foundation for informed decision-making and further research in the project.
